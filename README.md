# Dynamic intensity normalization using eigen flat fields in X-ray imaging

- Real Data: scripts to test DFFC with real data from i23
- Simulated/synthetic data: scripts to simulate projections and test DFFC
(contains a synth_data.h5 so we can test with the same simulation)
- Vincent Data
- DFFC_func.py: script containing the final version of DFFC (maybe you'll find
some scripts that call the tomobar normaliser rather than the function directly,
so it might be convenient to copy/past it there)
